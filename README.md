# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING TIME SERIES

Dataset:
Utilized an expansive dataset containing stock prices of S&P 500 companies across diverse domains, enabling robust cross-domain analysis.

Methodology:
1. Data Pre-processing: Employed NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas for thorough data cleansing, normalization, and advanced feature engineering.
2. Model Development: Constructed RNN, LSTM, and GRU models using Keras and TensorFlow, tailored for time series stock data analysis.
3. Algorithm Selection: Incorporated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) within Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to enhance prediction accuracy.
4. Comparative Analysis: Conducted an extensive comparative study among vanilla RNN, LSTMs, and GRUs, highlighting a marginal 5% accuracy variation between GRU and RNN+LSTM models.

Outcome:
The meticulously engineered models achieved an impressive 5% mean accuracy variation. The project's success underscores the potential of Deep Learning for stock price prediction, demonstrating its tangible real-world application.

This project not only showcases my adeptness in data processing and Deep Learning but also underscores my capacity to apply cutting-edge techniques to intricate financial datasets, yielding accurate and valuable predictions.
